The meeting will be in downtown Portland, at the former Multnomah Hotel, built in 1912.   We have negotiated a room rate of $165 per night, which includes a full breakfast <strong>and</strong> a happy hour with drinks and snacks.

Originally, the hotel had 700 guest rooms, in the style of 1912, with bathrooms down the hall.  The guest rooms have been completely remodelled, with two or three of the old rooms being converted into modern suites comprising a bedroom, bathroom, and living room.  The reception and meeting rooms mostly retain their early 20th Century splendour.
<p />
The meeting schedule will follow our normal pattern, with members and visitors gathering on Sunday evening, and the meeting taking place Monday morning to Friday lunch-time.  
Wednesday afternoon will be reserved for an excursion, yet to be planned.  We will eat one or two lunches and a dinner at the hotel; other meals will be arranged at nearby restaurants.
<p />
If you wish to arrive earlier or stay later, Mount Hood (skiing) and the Oregon Coast (storm-watching) are within easy reach for a day or overnight trip.  If you are flying in to Portland International Airport (PDX), downtown is easily accessed form the airport using the MAX train (fare = $2.50).
