## Getting There

ONT is by far the preferable airport, though there will be few (if any)
flights into it from further east than Denver.

LAX is an easy destination, especially for international folks. There
are a variety of shuttle services as well as the usual private taxis
and ubers---you can either go all the way to Claremont, or take the
LAX FlyAway shuttle to LA Union Station and then take a train. (Do
_not_ take the train to Pomona, which is a different nearby town on a
different train line.) The train only runs once per hour and stops
running at 9:38pm ([full Sunday schedule](https://metrolinktrains.com/schedules/?type=station&originId=107&destinationId=114&weekend=4)).  If you will take the train, download the
metrolink app so you can buy your ticket in advance (e.g., while
riding the bus).  Uber and Lyft are also reasonable to take, but will
cost abou $75 to $100 depending on traffic and require you to take a
shuttle to a parking lot before calling the car.

Santa Ana (SNA) and Burbank (BUR) are also worth considering, as they
will avoid having to traverse the most heavily trafficked parts of
LA's horrible highway system.

Once you're in Claremont, there's no need for a car (unless you want
to explore the mountains to the north or the desert to the east).

## Accommodations

There are two hotels in town that make sense to use:

  - The Doubletree
    https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/ontcldt-doubletree-claremont/
    1.1mi walk to Edmunds (where we'll be meeting)

  - Casa 425
    https://www.casa425.com/
    0.7mi walk to Edmunds

The Doubletree is a bit cheaper, but is in a kind of blah north side of
town. (The piano bar next door is great if you like bad bars.) Casa 425
is substantially pricier, but is in the cute village downtown.

We haven't reserved a room block---the Doubletree had a penalty clause
they wouldn't relent on---but there should be plenty of rooms. There are
also AirBnBs in the area. The Clarmeont Lodge and Motel 6 down by the
highway are discouraged (long walk, crappy part of town---but not
unsafe).

## Schedule

The precise schedule is TBD. There will be an optional group outing (a hike in the local foothills) on Wednesday afternoon.
