<h2><a name="Program"> </a> Program </h2>
<p />
The meeting starts on Monday morning October 3 at 9AM and ends with lunch on Friday October 7. 
<p />
The program consists of a series of 50 minute sessions, which are scheduled during the meeting. In each session the speaker gets 25 minutes to present and the audience gets 25 minutes to discuss, in no particular order (although we tend to give the presenter a couple of minutes to at least introduce the topic). Time is administered using a chess clock. (If attendance is high we may have to reduce session times somewhat.)
<p />
Prospective speakers are invited to send a talk proposal including title and abstract to the chair (<a href="mailto:e.visser@tudelft.nl">Eelco Visser</a>).
<p />

<p />
The meeting room is situated on the top floor of building BC, one of EPFL's
main computer science buildings which boasts ample seating and meeting
space and a large terrace with stunning views of Lake Geneva and the Alps.
Lunches will be provided in an on campus cafeteria at EPFL, and afternoon
coffee and snacks will also be provided in the meeting room area. Wifi will
be available via the campus guest network or eduroam, and a cafeteria is
just a few steps away where an assortment of drinks, coffee, and snacks are
available throughout the day for sale.

<h2><a name="Getting_There"> </a> Getting There </h2>
<p />
<p />
The nearest airport is the Geneva airport (GVA) a well-connected mid-size international airport with many nonstop long-haul flights arriving/departing daily. The Geneva airport is about a 40 minute train/metro ride from EPFL. One can take a direct train from the train station at the Geneva airport to Lausanne or Renens, from there, EPFL is just a short metro ride away.
<p />
Another large and well-connected Swiss airport is the Zurich airport (ZRH) which serves more long-haul destinations nonstop than the Geneva airport. The Zurich airport is about 2.5 hours by train from Lausanne, and can be worth the trip for a convenient nonstop itinerary. One can take a direct train from the Zurich airport to the Lausanne train station, and from there, EPFL is just a short metro ride away.
<p />
<h2><a name="Accommodation"> </a> Accommodation </h2>
<p />
We have booked a block of 20 rooms in the SwissTech Hotel, a new, modern
hotel that is minimal, comfortable, and affordable, and only 5-10 minutes
by foot from the meeting room at EPFL. Our group rate is 120CHF/night
(~$120) which is quite affordable for Lausanne.
<p />
If you're interested in taking one of these rooms, you must claim and pay
for your room by September 1, 2016. Contact Heather (<a href="mailto:heather.miller@epfl.ch">heather.miller@epfl.ch</a>)
to get the ball rolling (rooms are first come, first serve!)
<p />
Else, there are many other hotels in the city center of Lausanne, situated
~20 minutes via public transit from EPFL. Affordable hotels include: LHotel
Flon, Hotel Ibis Lausanne Centre, and the Swiss Wine Hotel. If staying in
one of these hotels, budget at least 30 minutes for the commute to EPFL in
the mornings.
<p />
Note that all guests of a Lausanne hotel receive free public transport
cards good for all forms of public transit in Lausanne.
