## Registration, Hotel Booking, and Payment

> **Please register by November 30 in order to guarantee room availability!**

Registration is a 3-step process:

1. **Fill out the [registration form](TBD)**
2. **Pay the registration fee**
3. **Book a hotel room**

All payments are to the hotel Las Majadas. See below for the details.


### Registration Fee

After filling out the [registration form](TBD), you should proceed to pay the registration fee.

The registration fee includes meeting room & equipment, coffee breaks, meals, and outing. The first included meal is lunch on Monday, the last included meal is lunch on Friday.

**Pay your registration via this [online payment form](https://www.webpay.cl/form-pay/106)**.

The form is in Spanish so:
* *Correo*: your email
* *Nombre*: your full name---*add `(WGLD)` at the end, to facilitate tracking by the hotel*
* *Rut*: if you are not Chilean, put `555555555` (9 digits)---that's the standard wildcard for foreigners (great design üòâ)
* *Monto*: `720000` (seven hundred twenty thousand)---that's 750 USD converted in Chilean pesos (CLP).

Then click on the "Pagar" button. You'll be directed to another page where you can choose the payment method; click on "Tarjetas" (cards). They accept Visa, Mastercard, and Amex.

> **IMPORTANT:** After validating the payment, send your payment receipt in PDF to [wgld26@dcc.uchile.cl](mailto:wgld26@dcc.uchile.cl)


### Hotel Booking

Once the hotel has received your registration payment receipt, they will contact you in order to proceed with the booking of your room. 

They will ask for your credit card as a means of securing your booking. The actual guarantee on the card will activate on March 2nd. The payment itself will be done upon checkout, as usual. 

Note that at checking time, you will need to present your *travel entry receipt*, a small paper slip provided by the Chilean authorities at the airport. This receipt is important for exiting the country, so *keep it safe!*.


### Room Sharing and Guests

It is possible to share a room with another participant. If so, mention it when you are contacted by the hotel regarding your room. Up to 2 persons can share a room, at no extra cost.

If you bring along a guest (not a WGLD meeting participant), [contact me by email](mailto:etanter@dcc.uchile.cl?subject=[WGLD]%20guest), indicating the days/meals they intend to have and if they will join the outing, so that I can calculate and confirm the amount to be paid. The payment will have to be carried out through the same online payment form as your registration.

### Outing

The registration fee includes an outing, details will be announced soon-ish.


## Travel

### Airport

It's easy, there's just one option: Santiago de Chile (SCL).

### Hotel

The hotel Las Majadas is [located South of Santiago](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Las+Majadas,+Hotel+%26+Centro+de+Reuniones+-+Jose+Julio+Nieto+s%2Fn,+Loteo+Parque+Las+Majadas,+Pirque,+Regi%C3%B3n+Metropolitana/@-33.6335686,-70.5398451,15z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x9662d6058305213b:0xb9d06cafacae1603!2m2!1d-70.536402!2d-33.634182!3e0), just on the outside of the city. There is not much within walking distance of the hotel, so if you're spending more time in Santiago, I would recommend not staying longer at Las Majadas, but in the city itself (see below about [Staying in Santiago](#staying-in-santiago)).

If you're coming straight from the airport, then the most convenient is to arrange a (private) transfer via [Transvip](https://transvip.cl) or any other official booth at the airport (situated after customs, *before* exiting to the hall). Avoid other taxi offers that you'll get when you arrive in the hall. The trip should take ~1h.

If you're coming from Santiago, you can get to Las Majadas by Uber, Cabify, Didi, or standard taxis. I would recommend using an app, this way you're sure that the driver won't trick you (they are good at this). This should take ~40 min depending on the time of day and traffic conditions (up to 1h).

If you want a cheaper (but not necessarily faster) way to commute between Santiago
and Las Majadas, you can take Metro Line 4 down to the Puente Alto station, and then take a car (Uber/etc.) to Las Majadas. I don't recommend this option, except maybe at peak hours---it's safer and easier to grab a car from the central areas of Santiago (see below about [Staying in Santiago](#staying-in-santiago)).

Car rentals are also an option of course. Both Waze and Google Maps work very well here.

### Staying in Santiago

Santiago is a geographically vast city, divided in "comunas". The standard of living and level of safety varies greatly from comunas to comunas. I recommend finding a hotel or rental in one of the following comunas:

* Providencia
* √ëu√±oa
* Vitacura
* Las Condes

Santiago Centro (the historical center) is not so great/safe to stay, depending on your expectations. It is entirely fine (and recommended!) to visit, though, as long as you apply basic safety guidelines that apply in any (developing/emerging) country. 

Don't hesitate to [ask me](mailto:etanter@dcc.uchile.cl?subject=[WGLD]%20question) if in doubt.

## Frequently Asked Questions (TO BE DONE)

### What if I arrive after 22:00 at the hotel?

The hotel reception is open until 10pm.
Please notify the hotel in advance if you plan to arrive after 10pm.

### How to purchase train & bus tickets?

I highly recommend installing the [SBB Mobile App](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travel-information/apps/sbb-mobile.html) to get your tickets for public transportation (trains, tram, bus, ...) in Switzerland and even to/from nearby Italy (e.g., to/from Milano Malpensa airport). The app includes the schedule with real-time information on possible delays. Alternatively, you could also buy tickets on the [SBB web site](https://www.sbb.ch/en).

Note that on the App and the web site you can buy tickets that combine multiple segments, even across the border (e.g., from Malpensa airport all the way to Meride, Paese).

At [Mendrisio station](https://www.sbb.ch//en/travel-information/stations/find-station/station.5305.mendrisio.html), like at every train station, there will be a [ticket machine](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travel-information/stations/services-ticket-machine/sbb-ticket-machine.html) (accepting payment also by credit card), but the ticket counter is **closed** on Sunday.

At the [Meride, Paese bus stop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zCtLbqkQeHvyf9CA7), there is **no ticket machine** (it's just a sign in a small village). However, you will get a free "[Ticino Ticket](https://www.mendrisiottoturismo.ch/en/pianifica/come-muoversi/ticino-ticket.html)" from the hotel when you check in, and that ticket is valid for public transportation within Ticino (but not all the way to Italy/Malpensa) up to midnight on the day of checkout.

### How to pay for a taxi?

Taxis should accept credit cards (MasterCard, Visa).

### Where do I find taxis and busses at the Mendrisio train station?

While there are three marked taxi parking spots right in front of the station (see photo above), there don't seem to be any taxis waiting. Reserve your taxi ahead of time (e.g., [Alpha Taxi Mendrisio](https://www.taxi-mendrisio.com/en/services-4/about-6-1)). If you didn't make a reservation, you might still be able to call them to get them to pick you up.

There is a **bus** island right at the train station (on the side of the station building, in the direction towards Lugano, see photo above). The bus only gets you to the village of Meride. You still need to get from there to the hotel. Their "shuttle" from Meride to the hotel is CHF 30, and you should have reserved it two days ahead of time. (I suspect the "shuttle" is just a taxi they call for you. It's probably so expensive because they need to first get to the little village of Meride, so you pay for much more than just the 5 km they actually carry you. You might want to walk from Meride to the hotel, but it's an hour-long walk through the woods...)

### How to drive to the hotel?

The last part of the street to the hotel is a [quite narrow, single-lane, curvy, paved road through the woods](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J1UGHZdHDAVd33uM7). If you encounter an oncoming car, you might have to back up a little to a spot where you can cross. There should be almost no traffic (the road pretty much ends at the hotel), so chances that you will encounter an oncoming car are rather small.

### Power and video adapters?

If possible, bring a power adapter (the [Swiss power plugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_441011) are different from EU plugs) and an adapter for your laptop's video output. We probably will have an HDMI cable for the projector.

### What will the weather be like?

The [weather in our area](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/local-forecasts/serpiano/6867.html#forecast-tab=weekly-overview) has been wetter than it used to be in the past. Bring an umbrella and a rain jacket.

### Will there be dinner and socializing on Sunday evening?

If you arrive before dinner (the hotel restaurant's dinner times are 18:30 - 21:00), you may want to have dinner at the hotel (Sunday dinner is not included in our package). Also, you can meet up at the bar, which is open 19:30 to 22:30.

If the weather is nice, it might be great to sit outside on the terrace with a view down onto the lake.

### Other questions about the hotel?

The [Serpiano hotel has an FAQ](https://www.serpiano.ch/en/faq.php) with more info.
Also, they offer bike rentals, and they have a spa you may want to try out.
