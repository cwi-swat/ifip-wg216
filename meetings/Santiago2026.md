Registration is a 3-step process:

1. **Fill out the [registration form](https://forms.gle/P29mAG39cwUQ3ZuX7)**
2. **Pay the registration fee**
3. **Book a hotel room**

All payments are to the hotel Las Majadas. See below for the details.


### Registration

After filling out the [registration form](https://forms.gle/P29mAG39cwUQ3ZuX7), you should proceed to pay the registration fee.

The registration fee includes meeting room & equipment, coffee breaks, meals, and outing. The first included meal is lunch on Monday, the last included meal is lunch on Friday.

**Pay your registration via this [online payment form](https://www.webpay.cl/form-pay/106)**.

The form is in Spanish so:
* *Correo*: your email
* *Nombre*: your full name---*add `(WGLD)` at the end, to facilitate tracking by the hotel*
* *Rut*: if you are not Chilean, put `555555555` (9 digits)---that's the standard wildcard for foreigners (great design 😉)
* *Monto*: `720000` (seven hundred twenty thousand)---that's 750 USD converted in Chilean pesos (CLP).

Then click on the "Pagar" button. You'll be directed to another page where you can choose the payment method; click on "Tarjetas" (cards). They accept Visa, Mastercard, and Amex.

> **IMPORTANT:** After validating the payment, send your payment receipt in PDF to [wgld26@dcc.uchile.cl](mailto:wgld26@dcc.uchile.cl)


### Hotel Booking

Once the hotel has received your [registration payment](#registration) receipt, they will contact you in order to proceed with the booking of your room. 

They will ask for your credit card as a means of securing your booking. The actual guarantee on the card will activate on March 2nd. The payment itself will be done upon checkout, as usual. 

Note that at checking time, you will need to present your *travel entry receipt*, a small paper slip provided by the Chilean authorities at the airport. This receipt is important for exiting the country, so *keep it safe!*.


### Room Sharing and Guests

It is possible to share a room with another participant. If so, mention it when you are contacted by the hotel regarding your room. Up to 2 persons can share a room, at no extra cost.

If you bring along a guest (not a WGLD meeting participant), [contact me by email](mailto:etanter@dcc.uchile.cl?subject=[WGLD]%20guest), indicating the days/meals they intend to have and if they will join the outing, so that I can calculate and confirm the amount to be paid. The payment will have to be carried out through the same online payment form as your registration.

### Outing

The registration fee includes an outing, details will be announced soon-ish.


## Travel

### Airport

It's easy, there's just one option: Santiago de Chile (SCL).

### Hotel

The hotel Las Majadas is [located South of Santiago](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Las+Majadas,+Hotel+%26+Centro+de+Reuniones+-+Jose+Julio+Nieto+s%2Fn,+Loteo+Parque+Las+Majadas,+Pirque,+Regi%C3%B3n+Metropolitana/@-33.6335686,-70.5398451,15z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x9662d6058305213b:0xb9d06cafacae1603!2m2!1d-70.536402!2d-33.634182!3e0), just on the outside of the city. There is not much within walking distance of the hotel, so if you're spending more time in Santiago, I would recommend not staying longer at Las Majadas, but in the city itself (see below about [Staying in Santiago](#staying-in-santiago)).

If you're coming straight from the airport, then the most convenient is to arrange a (private) transfer via [Transvip](https://transvip.cl) or any other official booth at the airport (situated after customs, *before* exiting to the hall). Avoid other taxi offers that you'll get when you arrive in the hall. The trip should take ~1h.

If you're coming from Santiago, you can get to Las Majadas by Uber, Cabify, Didi, or standard taxis. I would recommend using an app, this way you're sure that the driver won't trick you (they are good at this). This should take ~40 min depending on the time of day and traffic conditions (up to 1h).

If you want a cheaper (but not necessarily faster) way to commute between Santiago
and Las Majadas, you can take Metro Line 4 down to the Puente Alto station, and then take a car (Uber/etc.) to Las Majadas. I don't recommend this option, except maybe at peak hours---it's safer and easier to grab a car from the central areas of Santiago (see below about [Staying in Santiago](#staying-in-santiago)).

Car rentals are also an option of course. Both Waze and Google Maps work very well here.

### Staying in Santiago

Santiago is a geographically vast city, divided in "comunas". The standard of living and level of safety varies greatly from comunas to comunas. I recommend finding a hotel or rental in one of the following comunas:

* Providencia
* Ñuñoa
* Vitacura
* Las Condes

Santiago Centro (the historical center) is not so great/safe to stay, depending on your expectations. It is entirely fine (and recommended!) to visit, though, as long as you apply basic safety guidelines that apply in any (developing/emerging) country. 

Don't hesitate to [ask me](mailto:etanter@dcc.uchile.cl?subject=[WGLD]%20question) if in doubt.

## Frequently Asked Questions (WIP)

### What facilities are available at Las Majadas?

Free of charge, we will have access to a small gym (with a couple of machines), a wet and dry sauna, an outdoor pool, and bikes to ride in the park. 

They also have a Spa section that offers massages, for which you'd have to pay separately.

### How to purchase metro & bus tickets in Santiago?

As a foreigner, your only option is to acquire a physical card, called a Bip card (*tarjeta Bip!*). You can buy a Bip card at any metro station (and some shops with the "Bip!" sign), with an initial amount. The card is rechargeable. It works for both metro and buses. 

If possible, favor metro, but the grid is rather sparse, so you may have to take a bus (or a car, see below). 

Google Maps app has great knowledge of the public transportation network in Santiago, so this should probably be your go-to solution to figure out how to get anywhere.


### What about taxis (and alternatives)?

Taxi drivers tend to be fishy with foreigners. If you don't know your way, be sure to follow the route on some map app. If you pay in cash, be super clear about the bill(s) your handing the driver, so that he does not pretend you gave a lower amount afterward, and double-check your change. Most taxis should have a machine for card payments, but you may want to confirm before boarding.

For all these reasons, I would highly recommend using ride-sharing apps instead. Uber, Didi, and Cabify are very active and reliable in Santiago, and the prices are often more interesting. If you have several of these apps, don't hesitate to check on each, prices vary.

On these apps, you can also request standard taxis, and then you have the guarantee of smooth payment (via the app), no journey tricks, etc.

### What will the weather be like?

March is the end of the summer, and is usually a very pleasant period, sunny and warm. For people familiar with Salt Lake City and its surroundings, it's quite similar (dry, mountains around, etc.).

Asking Google shows the following monthly averages so you can get an idea:

| Month | High / Low (°C) | Rain |
|---|---|---|
| Feb | 30° / 11° | 0 days| 
| Mar | 28° / 10° | 0 days|
| Apr | 24° / 7°  | 1 day|

Note that it's rather fresh at night (especially that we'll be rather close to the mountains and in the outside of the city). 

Not much use for an umbrella normally 😅.


### Power and video adapters?

[See here for power plugs](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/chile/).

I'm confirming with the hotel regarding the available cables for the projector. Stay tuned.

### Will there be dinner and socializing on Sunday evening?

Yes, although not included in the registration. I'm confirming the hours with the hotel. Stay tuned.

### Can I check-in late?

I'm confirming the details with the hotel. Stay tuned.


### What about interesting tourist destinations in Chile?

There's a ton of wonderful places around, from the desert and salt lakes of the North to the glaciars and fjords of the South, with volcanoes along the 4000+ kms of Andes mountain, and the same length of Pacific coast. And that's without talking about Easter Island or the Antartic. 

I can't really do it justice here, and of course, there's abundant information on the web.
